# Contributions
Any contributions or suggestions are more than welcome. 
If you have a suggestion, [open an issue](https://github.com/swup/swup/issues/new) or contact me at <a href="mailto:gmarcuk@gmail.com?subject=I want to be a swup contributor">gmarcuk@gmail.com</a>. 

Creating [plugins]({{ "/plugins/create-plugin" | relative_url }}) and [themes]({{ "/themes/create-theme" | relative_url }}) is encouraged.
If you think your plugin idea could be useful for everyone, I will gladly add anyone to the organisation and create a repo for you - maintenance is on you tho. 
Any future changes after release of an official plugin will go through a PR process.  
In any case, don't forget to let me know, so the plugin can be at least referenced in the docs leading to your github repo. 
  
If you just can't get your head around how much swup makes your life easier, you can [buy me a beer](https://www.paypal.me/gmrchk).
